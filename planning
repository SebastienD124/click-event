Make an empty HTML file, put three buttons inside the body and an empty main tag below the buttons.
The text of the buttons should be "Foo", "Bar", and "FooBar" respectively. 
Don't put the " in the buttons that's just for clarification in these instructions.
Add unique IDs to each button
In your JavaScript, get 3 separate references to the buttons using the IDs you made and store them in variables.
You should use either document.querySelector or document.getElementByID, both will work.
Create a click event listener on each button.
When the "Foo" button is clicked, an h3 with the text "Foo" should be created and appended to the main tag. 
When the "Bar" button is clicked, an h3 with the text "Bar" should be created and appended to the main tag.
When the "Foobar" button is clicked, an h2 with the text "FooBar" should be created and appended to the main tag
